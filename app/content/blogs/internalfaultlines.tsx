      {/* INTRO */}
      <Lead>
        In a class that was otherwise filled with debate on the US–China trade
        war, de-dollarization, and BRICS expansion, I couldn’t help but pose
        this question to myself: what if India’s biggest geopolitical
        conundrums were not in global boardrooms or the Line of Actual Control
        — but in its own backyard?
      </Lead>

      <P>
        This article consciously turns the lens inwards, to two profoundly
        Indian issues that rarely make it into mainstream international
        relations discourse: inter-state migration and inter-state water
        conflicts. These might not have fighter aircraft or trade embargoes,
        but they show deep tensions in India’s federal system — tensions that,
        as outlined by Raveesh, might determine the nation’s future stability
        far more than traditional foreign threats.
      </P>

      {/* SECTION: MIGRATION */}
      <H2>Migration and the Quiet Crisis of Urban India</H2>

      <P>
        India’s story of urban expansion is indistinguishable from that of its
        domestic migration patterns. Approximately 37% of India’s workforce
        are internal migrants, as stated by the 2022 Economic Survey. They are
        mostly workers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal,
        keeping the economic wheels of urban centres such as Delhi, Mumbai,
        Bengaluru, and Chennai rolling.
      </P>

      <P>
        But the socio-political reaction to this mobility has turned sharply
        post-COVID. Following Raveesh’s theoretical definition of
        securitization, in which non-conventional problems such as migration
        are re-characterised as threats, Indian states are increasingly
        portraying migrants as security liabilities.
      </P>

      <P>
        Political rhetoric from Maharashtra, particularly the narrative around
        “outsiders,” has fueled cultural suspicion. Migrants are frequently
        framed as economic menaces, despite being the backbone of urban labour
        markets.
      </P>

      <P>
        This securitization is being converted into policy. Haryana and other
        states have introduced legislation reserving a percentage of private
        sector jobs for locals. Migrants are still under-documented and
        underserved despite initiatives such as One Nation, One Ration Card
        (ONORC) and e-Shram.
      </P>

      <P>
        The impact is visible on the ground. Bengaluru, for instance, struggles
        with housing stress, infrastructure overload, and transport
        bottlenecks. Similar strains are visible in Mumbai and Delhi. Migration
        is treated as a threat to be managed, rather than a structural reality
        to be planned for.
      </P>

      {/* SECTION: WATER */}
      <H2>Water Disputes: Rivers as Faultlines</H2>

      <P>
        While migration reveals social fault lines, water conflicts emphasise
        India’s federal system’s ecological and territorial vulnerabilities.
        Since most Indian rivers traverse several states, both natural
        endowment and political bargaining determine access.
      </P>

      <P>
        The Cauvery dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu flared again in
        2023, driven by poor monsoon conditions and agricultural distress.
        Despite Supreme Court rulings, enforcement remains politically
        contentious, exposing the limits of judicial authority in federal
        disputes.
      </P>

      <P>
        In June 2025, fresh protests broke out against dam construction on
        Brahmaputra tributaries. China’s upstream projects further complicate
        India’s water security calculus, adding a geopolitical layer to
        internal ecological stress.
      </P>

      <P>
        The common thread is clear: when essential resources become
        securitized, cooperation almost always fails. Trust breaks down, and
        short-term political advantage takes precedence over long-term
        sustainability.
      </P>

      {/* CONCLUSION */}
      <H2>Conclusion: Securing Unity Beyond Borders</H2>

      <P>
        India’s geopolitical importance does not reside in alliances or
        military preparedness alone. As Raveesh reminds us, geopolitics also
        encompasses the management of people, resources, and territory within
        borders.
      </P>

      <P>
        Instead of viewing migration as an issue to be contained and water as
        a tool to intimidate, India must shift towards cooperative federalism.
        This involves depoliticizing migration, decentralizing water
        management, strengthening inter-state institutions, and ensuring that
        economic growth does not come at the expense of human dignity or
        ecological disaster.
